  <h4>Doggy Walking Hints and Suggestions!</h4>
<p>Walking a puppy or dog is important for both owner and pet. You do not need a garden or a park. As long as you are willing to walk, walking by the local shops helps to socialize your pet and accustom him or her to their environment!</p>

<h4>Quick and Easy Ingrediants!</h4>
<p>I use eggs, stale bread, white boiled rice and raw meat to create tasty dog food. Dogs recognize their own items like their food bowls, so donate an old large one! I love to watch my dog eat tasty food, it goes down really quickly!</p>
