		Training and playing with your dog and encourages positive habits like obedience and proper manners. 				Training your puppy early will give them a safe space, as dogs love a quiet place to sleep and relax 				especially when you are away from home. Socialization with other dogs and people helps them become 				conﬁdent and adaptable.

		Obedience training will help your furry friend know the rules to follow. Walking is about so much more 		than just getting your dog out for “potty breaks.” It provides exercise, mental stimulation, a chance to    		socialize, and even presents an opportunity for training.

	<h2>Walking is an EVERYDAY activity.</h2>

		Walking also gets you out and about, which will beneﬁt your mental and physical well- being. There are 				many beneﬁts to a simple walk for you both, which we have listed below. We realize not all dogs are as 				enthusiastic as others about walks, especially when the house is cozy and it’s chilly outside.

		Dogs that don’t get enough exercise risk becoming obese, which can lead to various health risks like 		liver and cardiovascular disease, insulin resistance, and osteoarthritis. Obesity also results in a 				shortened lifespan and can be costly regarding veterinarian bills and specialized diets. 

		Getting your dog on a regular walking schedule will shed pounds and make it easier for them to 		participate in even more activities, like playing or running! If your dog is older, it will also improve 		joint health, which can stiffen up as your dog ages. Just like you!
