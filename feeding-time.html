        <h3>Puppies and Older dogs are different and have different food routines</h3>
        <ul>
           <li>Puppies eight to 12 weeks old need four meals a day.</li>
           <li>Feed puppies three to six months old three meals a day.</li>
           <li>Feed puppies six months to one year two meals a day.</li>
           <li>When your dog reaches his ﬁrst birthday, one meal a day is usually enough.</li>
           <li>For some dogs, including larger canines or those prone to bloat, smaller meals.</li>
	</ul>

		<p><em><b>Premium-quality</b></em> dry food provides a well-balanced diet for adult dogs and may be 				mixed with water, broth or canned food. Your dog may enjoy cottage cheese, cooked eggs or fruits and 				vegetables, but these additions should not total more than ten percent of his daily food intake.</p>
		</div>
   
                 <p>Puppies should be fed a high-quality, brand-name puppy food (large breed puppy foods for large breeds). Please limit<b>"people food,"</b>however, because it can result in vitamin and mineral imbalances, bone and teeth problems and may cause very picky eating habits and obesity. Clean, fresh water should be available at all times and be sure to wash food and water dishes daily.</p>

         <h3>Obesity and Human Food</h3>
         <p>
		Don't overfeed your dog, it will signiﬁcantly impact their health and happiness. More than 50% of dogs 			worldwide are obese and this number is on the rise. Overweight dogs are at increased risk of metabolic 		abnormalities, cardiovascular disease, joint diseases, a lowered immune system, and many other health 		problems. They also are less mobile and can’t run, play, or do other activities as much as they’d like. 		Do your pet a favor, feed them the amount recommended by their vet and don’t give in to those puppy dogs’ 		eyes when they ask for more!
	</p>

          
          <p>Many human foods, such as chocolate, avocados, or onions, are toxic to dogs and can have serious ramiﬁcations to their health. Keep human food out of reach and be especially careful with gum and candies, as many contain xylitol which is a sugar-like substance toxic to dogs. Don’t feed your dog human foods on purpose unless recommended by your veterinarian. Some human foods, like plain chicken, canned pumpkin, or plain rice may be recommended intentionally by your vet for speciﬁc reasons such as digestive upset, diarrhea, to help hide oral medication or as highly motivating training treats in small quantities. In these instances “human food” may be appropriate for your dog, but they certainly don’t need to lick your dinner plate clean or eat your leftovers.</p>

          <p><b>You can cook your own dog food; it is healthier and cheaper on the purse as well. You can feed your dog well without it costing the earth.</b></p>
