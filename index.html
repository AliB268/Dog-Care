            <p>
                <b>"Select"</b> is defined in the dictionary by such phrases as <b> "a preferred choice"</b> or <b> "carefully 
                chosen"</b>. Selecting the family dog should be a well-researched and carefully soul-searched 
                activity. Are you and your family willing to make a 10 - 15 year commitment to this fur 
                puppy in sickness and in health, for richer and for poorer, for as long as all shall live? 
                Some parents bow to the pressure their children put on them to get a dog. The kids promise 
                with tears in their eyes that they will religiously take care of this soon-to-be best friend. 
                The truth of the matter is, during the 10 - 15 year lifespan of the average dog, your children 
                will be growing in and out of various life stages and the family dog's importance in their 
                lives will wax and wane like the tide. You cannot saddle a child with total responsibility 
                for the family dog and threaten to get rid of it if the child is not providing that care. 
                It is not fair to child or dog.
