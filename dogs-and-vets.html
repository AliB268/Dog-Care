	<h2>Regular Veterinary Checkups.</h2>
	<p><b>Regular</b> veterinary care visits help minimize the risk of serious complications, as they can help detect 	diseases and other issues early. Vaccinations safeguard your dog against contagious and potentially life-	threatening diseases and boost their immunity. Daily teeth cleaning will limit the risk of mouth issues as your 	dog ages, and your veterinarian can perform more comprehensive dental care if necessary.
	</p>
	<br>
	<p>Arrange to have your female dogs spayed and male dogs neutered to prevent accidental breeding and prevent 	diseases that can affect their reproductive organs, such as testicular cancer.
	Ensure you know how to contact your veterinarian in an emergency, even outside of normal clinic hours. If your 	pet has an accident, gets injured, eats something that might be toxic, or develops a rapid illness like vomiting 	and diarrhea, you will need to seek immediate veterinary care for them.
	In some countrieds you can also get pet insurance to help pay for your dog’s health and treatment if they are   	injured or need medical care.
	</p>

	<h3><b>Dental Care</b></h3>
	
	<p>Regularly brushing your dog's teeth, along with a healthy diet and plenty of chew toys, can go a long way 	toward keeping her mouth healthy. Bacteria and plaque-forming foods can cause build-up on a dog's teeth. This can 	harden into tartar, potentially causing gingivitis, receding gums and tooth loss. Many pooches show signs of gum 	disease by the time they're four years old because they aren't provided with proper mouth care.

	<h3><b>Eye Care</b></h3>
	<p>Giving your pup regular home eye exams will help keep you alert to any tearing, cloudiness or inﬂammation that 	may indicate a health problem. First, face your dog in a brightly lit area and look into his eyes. They should be 	clear and bright, and the area around the eyeball should be white. The pupils should be equal in size and there 		shouldn’t be tearing, discharge or any crust in the corners of his eyes. With your thumb, gently roll down your 		dog’s lower eyelid and look at the lining. It should be pink, not red or white.
	</p>
	<h3><b>Ear Care</b></h3>

	<br>
	</br>
	<p>Your dog’s regular grooming routine should include regular ear checks. This is especially important for dogs 	who produce excessive earwax or have a lot of inner-ear hair. Don’t clean your dog’s ears so frequently or deeply 	as to cause irritation, and take care to never insert anything into your dog’s ear canal—probing inside can cause 	trauma or infection!
	</p>
	<br>
	<p>If your dog’s inner ears appear dirty, clean them with a cotton ball or piece of gauze dampened with mineral 	oil, hydrogen peroxide or a liquid ear cleaner specially formulated for this purpose.
	Fold your pet’s ear back gently and wipe away any debris or earwax that you can see on the
	underside of his or her ear. Be sure to lift away the dirt and wax rather than rubbing it into the ear.
	Because of the twisty, curvy design a dog’s inner ears, it’s easy for parasites, bacteria and yeast to hide in 	them and infections can often arise as a result of this trapped debris. Dogs with allergies are particularly 	vulnerable to complications, as are those with ﬂoppy ears, like Cocker spaniels, Basset Hounds and Poodles. Brown 	or black ear wax—and dry, dark wax resembling coffee grounds—are classic indicators of microscopic ear mites. 		Only your vet can tell for sure, so please don’t delay taking your dog in for a checkup.
	</p>

	<h2>Contact your veterinarian if you notice any of the following symptoms affecting your dog’s
ears.</h2>
	<ul>
	   <li>Ear discharge</li>
	   </li>Bad smells</li>
	   <li>Redness Swelling</li>
           <li>Crusty skin</li>
	   <li>Hair loss</li>
	</ul>
<br>
	<h2><b>Nail Care</b></h2>
	<p>As a rule of thumb, a dog’s nails should be trimmed when they just about touch the ground when he or she 	walks. If your pet’s nails are clicking or getting snagged on the ﬂoor, it’s time for a trim. For leisurely 	living dogs, this might mean weekly pedicures, while urban pooches who stalk rough city sidewalks can go longer 	between clippings.
	</p>
<br>
	<h2><b>Paw Care</b></h2>
	<p>The pads on the bottom of your pups feet provide extra cushioning to help protect bones and joints from shock, 	provide insulation against extreme weather, aid walking on rough ground and protect tissue deep within the paw. 	It’s important to check your pet’s feet regularly to make sure they’re free of wounds, infections or foreign 	objects that can become lodged.
	</p>
