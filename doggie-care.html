	<h2>Important aspects for Puppy or Dog care.</h2>
        <p>
            A dog can be a wonderful addition to any home, but whether you're an experienced pet parent 
            or a first-time adopter, it's important to keep your canine companion's health and happiness 
            a top priority. Below are some useful tips for all dog parents.
        </p>

            <h2>Dog Grooming.</h2>
            <p>
                Help keep your dog clean and reduce shedding with frequent brushing. Check for fleas and 
                ticks daily during warm weather. Most dogs don't need to be bathed more than a few times 
                a year. Before bathing, comb or cut out all mats from the coat. Carefully rinse all soap 
                out of the coat, or the dirt will stick to soap residue. You can also use flea and tick 
                sprays and powders to keep up bug deterrent and your pooch smelling clean. So, giving 
                daily inspections to your dog for fleas and ticks during the warm seasons is important. 
                Use a flea comb to find and remove fleas. There are several new methods of flea and tick 
                control. Speak to your veterinarian about these and other options.
            </p>

		<h3>Bath Time - can be fun!</h3>
	<div style="position: relative; height 500px;">
	<img src="Taking-A-Bath-Big-DOgs-2048x1152.jpg" alt="It's as simple as 1, 2, 3!"  class="absolute-position width="500">
	</div>

            <p>
		Regular grooming with a brush or comb will help keep your pet's hair in good condition by removing dirt, spreading natural oils throughout her                 	coat, preventing tangles and keeping her skin clean and irritant-free. Plus, grooming time is a great time to check for ﬂeas and ﬂea dirt—those                 	little black specks that indicate your pet is playing host to a ﬂea family. 
	    </p>
	    <p>
		<b>First</b>, give your pet a good brushing to remove all dead hair and mats, and then put him or her in a tub or sink that's been ﬁlled with 	about 		three to four inches of lukewarm water. Then, use a spray hose, large plastic pitcher or an unbreakable cup to completely wet your pet. Take 	care  		to not spray or pour water directly in his ears, eyes or nose. Gently massage in shampoo, working from head to tail, and rinse and repeat as 			needed. Dry him or her thoroughly by giving your pet a good rub with a large towel. Voila, clean pet!
            </p>
	
	<h3>Get your tools ready!</h3>
	<div style="position: relative; height 500px;">
	<img src="Dog-Grooming-Etiquette.jpg" alt="A dog ready for bath day!"  class="absolute-position width="500">
	</div>
	
	    <p>
		Dogs with loose facial skin or wrinkles like the <b>British Bull Dogs</b> will need special attention. To prevent dirt and bacteria from causing 			irritation and infection, clean the folds with damp cotton. Always thoroughly dry the areas between the folds. Some pups think that bath time is 			a perfect time to act goofy! Young puppies especially will wiggle and bounce all over the place, and tend to nip at bath time. If this sounds 				like your pet, put a ﬂoating toy in the tub with her so she can focus on that rather than on mouthing you.
 
	    </p>

	<h3><b>Choosing a Shampoo</b></h3>
	    <p>
		Using a shampoo formulated for pets is best. Human shampoos aren't toxic to pets, but some may contain fragrances or other substances that can 				irritate your pet's skin. Select a product that's speciﬁcally formulated for your species of animal, as some ingredients may be harmful when 				applied to different types of pets. It's always smart to talk with your pet's veterinarian to make sure you're selecting a shampoo that will 				meet your pet's needs.

	<h3>Bathing is Great for Doggy Health!</h3>

	</div>

	<h3><b>Doggy Skin Issues.</b></h3>
	
	    <p>
		Your dog’s skin is an indication of her overall health, so it’s important to keep it in prime shape. When a skin problem occurs, your dog may 				respond with excessive scratching, chewing and/or licking. A wide range of causes—including external parasites, infections, allergies, metabolic 			problems and stress, or a combination of these—may be to blame.

        <p class="Adoption-Notice">
            <b>Make note:</b> If you're considering bringing home a new dog, please make adoption your first 
            option. We encourage you to browse local vets and animal pounds for adoptable dogs in your 
            area or search, 'Find a Shelter' page to start your search. There are some important questions 
            to ask you and your family. Firstly, who will be looking after the new addition?
        </p>

        <section id="multimedia">
            <h3>Adoption</h3>
            <p>
                <b>"Select"</b> is defined in the dictionary by such phrases as <b> "a preferred choice"</b> or <b> "carefully 
                chosen"</b>. Selecting the family dog should be a well-researched and carefully soul-searched 
                activity. Are you and your family willing to make a 10 - 15 year commitment to this fur 
                puppy in sickness and in health, for richer and for poorer, for as long as all shall live? 
                Some parents bow to the pressure their children put on them to get a dog. The kids promise 
                with tears in their eyes that they will religiously take care of this soon-to-be best friend. 
                The truth of the matter is, during the 10 - 15 year lifespan of the average dog, your children 
                will be growing in and out of various life stages and the family dog's importance in their 
                lives will wax and wane like the tide. You cannot saddle a child with total responsibility 
                for the family dog and threaten to get rid of it if the child is not providing that care. 
                It is not fair to child or dog.
